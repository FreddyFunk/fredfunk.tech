Dear Linux kernel development team maintainer,

I would like to kindly request for comment on my application as a junior
Linux kernel developer at Canonical.

I am a tinkerer at heart with a passion for the most challenging technical
problems. Known as a driving force and quick learner in my professional
work environments, I am not afraid to ask for help or admit mistakes. One
of my favorite things at work is receiving honest and constructive
feedback, which I gratefully take as an opportunity to grow my engineering
expertise.

I have demonstrated great skills in writing high-performance C++ code,
efficient GPU compute/fragment shaders, and memory management
optimizations during my employment at KISTERS AG and FH Aachen - Aachen
University of Applied Sciences. At Zurich Insurance, I focused on
containerization, infrastructure cost optimizations, DevOps automation, and
Site Reliability Engineering. I also successfully lead and finished a
large multi-million budget IT project with 80+ members for over a year at
Zurich but went back to more technical challenges out of passion for
software engineering. In my free time, I code in C++ and Rust and follow
the development progress of the Linux kernel, Mesa, and various
open-source projects. This ignited a flame to get professionally involved
in Linux kernel development.

I have tremendous respect for anyone who has proven to be a great Linux
kernel developer, showing continuous excellence at a technical and
collaborative level. I consciously applied for the Junior position, as
this would be my first job working on the Linux kernel itself, marking a
significant leap from my current Linux user experience. I am eager to face
all the challenges that will come on this journey and would be proud to
become a member of the Canonical Kernel team.

In the short to mid-term at Canonical, my goals include successfully
upstreaming patches for the first time and gaining experience with Linux
kernel live patching and provide Kernel Livepatch updates to all currently
supported Linux kernel versions. I am also eager to assist with current
infrastructure changes to prevent future SRU cycle skips like the one
happening right now in September. Additionally, I would be thrilled to
contribute as an operational driving force in Canonicalâ€™s recent decision
to ship more recent Linux kernels in Ubuntu.

My long-term goal at Canonical is to become a RISC-V advocate and
collaborate with various third parties such as SiFive, Andes Technology,
DeepComputing, and Framework to provide the best possible Ubuntu
experience on their hardware. I am deeply committed to FOSS and would find
great fulfillment in making significant contributions to Linux as part of
the Canonical team.

I would be more than happy to receive an invitation for an interview from
you.
